Removed 'share this post' since I haven't been able to get it to work yet

Below is the code that was removed from 'detail'

<p>
  <a href="{% url "blog:post_share" blog.id %}">
    Share this post
  </a>
</p>

The code was between

{{ blog.description|safe }}

{% endblock %}

Next maybe try adding comments and work on the sharing post issue later

Pushing changes to pythonanywhere
*************************************************

# any packages installed with pip?
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

# check status
git status

git add .

git commit -m "[describe change]"

git status

git push origin

# Go to Bash console on pythonanywhere

# activate virutal environment
workon portfoliovenv

# move to django3-personal-portfolio
git pull origin

# for new requirements file
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Got this error message: ERROR: Could not install packages due to an OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/tmp/build/80754af9/django_1601563330930/work'
# Note, my requirements.txt file looked much different than the one in the tutorial

python manage.py migrate
python manage.py collectstatic
# yes if there are changes

# go to pythonanywhere > web and click on reload

# 1/21/22 Note: the updating still seemed to work. I am not sure why the requirements.txt file turned out that way.

- change password for /admin --make it harder to crack
- get tags working so that blogs can be sorted by topic

Completed 1/23/22
