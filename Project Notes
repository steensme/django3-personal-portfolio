Removed 'share this post' since I haven't been able to get it to work yet

Below is the code that was removed from 'detail'

<p>
  <a href="{% url "blog:post_share" blog.id %}">
    Share this post
  </a>
</p>

The code was between

{{ blog.description|safe }}

{% endblock %}

Next maybe try adding comments and work on the sharing post issue later
